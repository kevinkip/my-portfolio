        `Since I was 5 years old, sitting in a computer cafe with my mom, I've been fascinated with programming and all the cool things that you can do (Like playing Space Invaders ðŸš€)`,
        `Fast forward to high school, I discovered a little program called Dreamweaver that was the basic HTML tutorial that we took in class. It was bare bones, but my best friend and I ran with it and started messing with different programs (iPhone was just released).
        `,
        `As the years passed by, I learned more frameworks and skills to get to where I am now.`,
        `HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Angular, Tailwind, Swift, C#...so many different areas that have made me to the developer that I am today. It wasn't easy, but I enjoyed and look forward to what's next to come (generative AI perhaps)`
